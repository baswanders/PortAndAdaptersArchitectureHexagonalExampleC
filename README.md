# Ports and Adapters Architecture (Hexagonal) Example in C#/.NET Core

This is an example implementation of the Ports and Adapters Architecture (Hexagonal architecture), in C#.

## Read more about this example
This is the accompanying code from this blog post https://baswanders.com/ports-and-adaptors-hexagonal-architecture-in-c/

## Basic idea
The idea is to separate the core application logic from the external dependencies, such as databases, web services, etc. This way, the core application logic is not dependent on any external technology, and can be easily tested in isolation.

## Notes
Mind you that this example only shows the implementation of this architecture. It does not try to incorporate best practices of any other kind.
